                <p class="fragment">...yes, it's hard, done well.</p>
                <p class="fragment">Really? So, what's new Mr. Nava?</p>
            </section>

            <section>

                We know collaboration is important, Mr. Nava. Tell us something new...
                <p class="fragment">So, what is new about how teachers and students should/ought/will collaborate?</p>

                <p class="fragment">The Internet.</p>
                <p class="fragment">Wow, really Mr. Nava? Are you serious?</p>



            </section>

            <section>
                Well, yes, I'm serious, but how is this being done at the highest, and
                most organized level is the question?
            </section>

            <section>
                <h1>?</h1>
                <p class="fragment">It's being done in cloud assembly line

            </section>

            <section>
                So, Mr. Nava, really? What does this have to do with us, as techers
                and students in a public school?
                <p class="fragment">It's how we are all going to collaborate and work
                with one another...</p>
                <p class="fragment">If we are going to collaborate in the process of
                    creating, building, or solving a problem...</p>
                <p class="fragment">This is how it will be done...</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                So Why dont't we know about it? Or, if you do, why isn't it being
                used?
                <p class="fragment">Because it's challenging to use well.</p>
                <p class="fragment">There is a learing curve that comes with
                using DVC.
                </p>
                <p class="fragment">It will still take years for DVC to be adopted and
                used in K12</p>

            </section>

            <section>Question: If it's so complex, how do you expect teachers
                and students to adopt it?
                <p class="fragment">When people learn complex but effetive systems,
                they figure out simple and practical ways to use them and share them
                with others.</p>
                <p class="fragment">And that's where I'm at with DVC as a teacher.</p>

            </section>

            <section>
                I'm just hoping that it communicates something
                about me to you, and that it is decisive in you selecting me
                to teach here at Augustus.
                <p class="fragment">So, can I show you biefly how I'd use DVC?</p>

                <img src="img/HTML-DOM-Tree.png"></img>

            </section>

            <section>

                <p>
                    A component in Angular is used to render a portion of html
                    and provide functionality to that portion.
                </p>
                
                <p class="fragment">And this is done through a Component's class</p>

                <p class="fragment">...a TypeScript Class</p>
                <p class="fragment">And here is where application logic
                is defined for our components.</p>
                
                <code class="hljs fragment">class AppComponent {
                }
                </code>
            </section>

            <section>
                So, a component's TypeScript class, can have its properties and methods referenced
                from the component's template.
<pre><code class="hljs fragment" >
    @Component({
        selector: 'media-item',
        template: '{{ mediaItem.name }}'
})
    class AppComponent {
        mediaItem = {
            name: "Plato"
        }
    }
                </code></pre>
            </section>

            <section>
                With each component you can specify an html template, the markup that
                will get rendered, and from here reference properties and methods in the
                compponent's class.
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Dependency Injection</h2>
					<pre><code class="hljs" data-trim contenteditable>
function Person() {
  this.name = "Plato";    // instance variable
}

function sayHelloPerson() {
    var person = new Person();
    console.log("Hello " + person.name);
}
</code></pre>
                
            </section>

            <section>
                sayHello(); <br>
                Hello Plato
            </section>

            <section>
                In this example we have the function creating an object instance:
<pre>
<code class="hljs fragment">
function sayHelloPerson() {
    var person = new Person();
    console.log("Hello " + person.name);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p class="fragment">
    But, what we really want to do is have the Person object instance created by a parameter passed to a constructor function:
</p>

            </section>

            <section>
<pre>
<code class="hljs">
    function sayHelloPerson(person) {
        console.log("Hello " + person.name);
}

var person = new Person();
sayHelloPerson(person);
Hello Plato
</code>
</pre>
            </section>

            
            <section>
                <p>Our Immediate Goal:</p>
                <p class="fragment">
                    As I see it, but some of you might see it in another way, should be to know how to do this with TypeScript and pass on data in created in its classes to angular components and sub-components.
